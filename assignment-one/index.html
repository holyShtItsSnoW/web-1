        Hey hey, I'm Ryan, but I usually go by <b>SnoW.</b> I'm from Trenton, Nova Scotia, though currently living in NSCC's student housing for this course <em>(city rent is evil!)</em> Before this course, I took NSCC's Appled Media & Communications Course. Previous to that, I spent 2 years at Dalhousie for Applied Computer Science- however seeing as it was boring as hell, I dropped out. As for hobbies, I'm play an unfortunate amount of terrible video games <em>(Overwatch, Apex Legends, etc.)</em>, and I also collect vinyl's of my favourite music albums. Attached below is a photo of one of my 3 dogs from back home, Domino.
